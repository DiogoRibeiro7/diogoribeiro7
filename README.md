I build production systems that turn messy data into decisions.  
Across logistics, health and engineering I’ve focused on lean models, clean code, and reproducible pipelines.  
Lately I’ve been shipping **sensor analytics, survival data tools, drift / anomaly detection**, and **LLM-powered reporting** that help teams reason about time series and text in real time.
