I'm a veteran Data Scientist with over two decades of experience, hailing from the picturesque country of Portugal. My journey through computer science, economy, management, medicine, natural sciences, engineering, pure mathematics and applied mathematics has been a continuous source of fascination and inspiration. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I've delved into the intricate domains of supply chain, logistics, sustainability, finance, and health, where data-driven decision-making optimizes operations and promotes environmental responsibility.

üî≠ In research, I'm deeply immersed in applying machine learning and statistics to health. My work harnesses data to advance healthcare solutions and outcomes.

üî≠ My research also extends to mathematics, focusing on differential equations and partial differential equations. These tools apply to diverse fields such as epidemiology, economics, and sociology, helping unravel complex phenomena.

üî≠ I'm passionate about graph theory and its applications in social networks, where I uncover patterns and connections that provide valuable insights into human interactions.

üìà Beyond these areas, I'm intrigued by the potential of big data analytics in marketing, where customer behaviors and preferences can be decoded to enhance business strategies.

üìä I'm also fascinated by the emerging field of quantum computing and its potential to revolutionize problem-solving in cryptography and optimization.

üìê My research in statistics and probability involves developing models that accurately predict outcomes and assess risks. These models are crucial in fields like finance, insurance, and public policy, where they inform decision-making and strategy.

üåç Sustainability is another key interest, particularly in developing algorithms that promote renewable energy use and reduce carbon footprints.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating!
